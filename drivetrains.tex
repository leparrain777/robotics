\section{Tank Drive}
\subsection{Cost}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Needs only 2 gearboxes. (4 if designed for meccanum) (upgraded if 6 motors used)
    \item Motors used is up to the year, with options for 2 or 4. (or 6 with upgraded gearboxes)
    \item Wheels used is 6. ( or 4 if designed for meccanum)
    \item Can use any size of wheel if chains are used. Can use 6"+ if belts are used.
    \item Can use any type of wheel. (2 normal and 2 omni used for rotational axis change)
    \item Can use chain or belts with sprockets or pullies respectively.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Programming}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can be done by freshmen with some help.
    \item Extremely straightforeward.
    \item Short development time.
    \item Easiest to program for autonomous. Dead reckoning or encoder reading possible.
    \item No need for a relative heading from a gyro.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Capabilities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tied for best design for pushing in the direction of the wheels.
    \item Resists perpendicular pushing perfectly.
    \item Resists $Sin(|\Theta|)$ in general where $\Theta$ is the angle of the pushing force from perpendicular.
    \item Can rotate about anywhere on the axis of the center wheels.
    \item Single best option for traction reliability. (track optional to help traction if needed)
    \item One of the best options for max speed/acceleration as all motors are alligned.
    \item More compact and leaves more space for interior components.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Hinderances}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Must rotate to move in another direction.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Driver Usage}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Easiest to learn.
    \item No orientation required, no gyro/accelerometer drift.
    \item Easy to build and most likely part of a practive bot so easy to practice on.
    \item Easiest control scheme, only needs 2 axis to control leading to less human error.
    \item More likely to have experienced drivers.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Design and Build}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Easiest to design.
    \item Easiest to build.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Assembly and Repair}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Easiest to assemble if designed well.
    \item Easy but annoying to repair with chain and sprockets.
    \item Either easy or very hard to repair with belts. (spares required)
\end{itemize}

    \item Can use any combination of wheels types. (2 normal and 2 omni gives rotation about end instead)
    \item Can use chain or belts with sprockets or pullies respectively.
