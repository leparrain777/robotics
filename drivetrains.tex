\section{Tank Drive}
\subsection{Cost}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Needs only 2 gearboxes. (4 if designed for meccanum) (upgraded if 6 motors used)
    \item Motors used is up to the year, with options for 2 or 4. (or 6 with upgraded gearboxes)
    \item Wheels used is 6. ( or 4 if designed for meccanum)
    \item Can use any type of wheel if chains are used. Can use 6"+ if belts are used.
    \item Can use chain or belts with sprockets or pullies respectively.
    \item 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Programming}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can be done by freshmen with some help.
    \item Extremely straightforeward.
    \item Short development time.
    \item Easiest to program for autonomous. Dead reckoning or encoder reading possible.
    \item No need for a relative heading from a gyro.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Capabilities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tied for best design for pushing in the direction of the wheels.
    \item Resists perfendicular pushing perfectly.
    \item Resists $Sin(\Theta)$ in general where $\Theta$ is the absolute value of the angle of the pushing force from perpendicular.
\end{itemize}
